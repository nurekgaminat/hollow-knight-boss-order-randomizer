This program randomly chooses order of Hollow Knight bosses. It's not on a very high level but it works and thats what is important. 
And here is how it works:
- Radiance can be drawn only if you have 1800 essence or above
- Dream variants cannot be drawn before their normal variants
- bosses which are locked behind abilities are drawn only if you have this ability (or behind other bosses like Radiance):
     - Broken Vessel, Watcher Knights, Soul Master, Collector, Crystal Guardian, Elder Hu, Galien, God Tamer, Gorb, Great Prince Zote, Grimm,Hive Knight, Mantis Lords, Marmu, No Eyes, Nosk, Obobbles, Uumuu, Xero (locked behind dash and/or claws) 
     - White defender, Flukemarm - desolate dive
     - Markoth, Traitor Lord - shadow cloak
     - Hornet 2 (only easy mode), Enraged Guardian - monarch wings
Easy and Hard mode
There is easy and hard mode. TLDR: in easy mode before acquiring dash (beating hornet) bosses will be drawn only from these:
       False Knight, Brooding Mawlek, Gruz Mother, Massive Moss Charger , Vengefly king , Hornet
Second thing is that you can't fight Hornet 2 without wings
In hard mode you can:
- fight with Hornet 2 without wings
- more bosses without dash (you have to use fireball skips or sth): 
     Broken Vessel, Watcher Knights, Soul Master, Collector, Crystal Guardian, Elder Hu, Galien, God Tamer, Gorb, Great Prince Zote, Grimm,Hive Knight, Mantis Lords,     Marmu, No Eyes, Nosk, Obobbles, Uumuu, Xero

Basicly all the bosses locked behind claws/dash in easy mode

Have fun!
