This program randomly chooses order of Hollow Knight bosses. It's not on a very high level bur it works and thats what is important. 
And here is how it works:
- Dream variants cannot be drawn before their normal variants
- bosses which are locked behind abilities are drawn only if you have this ability (or behind other bosses like Radiance):
     - Broken Vessel, Watcher Knights, Soul            Master, Collector, Crystal Guardian, Elder Hu, Galien, God Tamer, Gorb, Great Prince Zote, Grimm,Hive Knight, Mantis Lords, Marmu, No Eyes, Nosk, Obobbles, Uumuu, Xero (locked behind dash and/or claws) 
     - Dung defender, Flukemarm, Grimm (one of the Grimmkins) (desolate dive) 
     - Markoth, Traitor Lord (shadow cloak) 
     - etc. 
Easy and Hard mode
There is easy and hard mode. TLDR: in easy mode before acquiring dash (beating hornet) bosses will be drawn only from these:
       [ 'False Knight', 'Brooding Mawlek', 'Gruz Mother', 'Massive Moss Charger' , 'Vengefly king' , 'Hornet']
Second thing is that you can't fight Hornet 2 and Enraged Guardian without wings
In hard mode you can:
- fight with Hornet 2 andwithout wings
- more bosses without dash (you have to use fireball skips or sth): 
Broken Vessel, Watcher Knights, Soul Master, Collector, Crystal Guardian, Elder Hu, Galien, God Tamer, Gorb, Great Prince Zote, Grimm,Hive Knight, Mantis Lords, Marmu, No Eyes, Nosk, Obobbles, Uumuu, Xero

Basicly all the bosses locked behind claws/dash in easy mode

Have fun!
